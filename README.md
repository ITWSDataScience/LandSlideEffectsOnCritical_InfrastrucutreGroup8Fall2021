# Abstract
  Critical Infrastructure pertains to those assets and facilities which are vital to a country and among those, facilities such as power plants, hospitals, urgent care facilities, and pharmacies are some of the most crucial to the general public. That is why there must be a consistent effort to maintain them and prevent disaster from disabling the aforementioned infrastructure. One of the most disabling disasters is landslides due to their immense potential to impact the surrounding environment. The damage to the environment can not only hinder the facilities' capability to provide services but also can damage bottlenecks on transport routes to the facilities themselves, such as bridges. So that’s why we’ll be using NASA’s Global landslide data as well the Homeland Infrastructure data sets regarding those pieces of critical infrastructure. For this project, we can limit it to a specific country, the United States, since there is readily available, verified data regarding the critical infrastructure. Once we process the data, we’ll be able to find out the effective disaster zone of landslides in an area and then locate the critical infrastructure facilities in that disaster zone. We aim to do this by applying unsupervised machine learning algorithms to our data and using the results gained from that to assign facilities a certain level of risk. 


# Data Sets
[Landslide Data](https://disc.gsfc.nasa.gov/datasets/Global_Landslide_Nowcast_1.1/summary?keywords=landslide)  

[Hospital Data](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/6ac5e325468c4cb9b905f1728d6fbf0f_0/explore?showTable=true)  

[Power Plant Data](https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/power-plants/explore?location=4.353707%2C-12.985721%2C2.00&showTable=true)  
# Aim  
To use the landslide data and correlations with critical infrastructure data to determine if certain areas have higher correlations with landslide and frequencies. We can then utilize this data to ensure that relevant facilities are allocated proper disaster relief funding as well as raising awareness about the tendency of landslides at certain geographical locations.
